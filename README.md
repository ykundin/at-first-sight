### What won't we consider?

Since this repository was created to participate in the [Telegram Mini App Contest](https://t.me/contest/327) and the result must be sent on October 9, 2023, then some of the topics will intentionally not be affected by us. They will be quite important if you really intend to create an application for a huge audience of users or assemble a development team for this.

- **Testing** — the larger the audience of your application and the wider the capabilities of your application, the more important the testing process becomes. Take this seriously and study this topic, especially in the case when you will provide users with paid features and earn money from it.

- **Performance monitoring** — Even a well-tested application may unexpectedly break down due to circumstances beyond your control. You need to set up monitoring of important metrics of your application and set up a notification system if something suddenly starts to differ greatly from the norm.

- **Teamwork** — if you plan to actively develop and change the application, then most likely you need to think about selecting a team and setting up a project for teamwork. For example, this may consist in setting up CI/CD pipelines that will allow you to automatically monitor the quality of the code, review the code and automatically deploy it to the servers…

### Shall we begin?

I always suggest starting the development of a new product (application) with the formulation of the key idea and the values that we will offer to our audience. After that, we should start carefully thinking through all the necessary features that we want to present to users in the first version in order to hook them at first sight!

This whole process can be described in one word — design — and it is the first step in our instructions, which is presented on a separate page.
